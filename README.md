Tell Ray about your family, goals, and financial strategy once. From then on, every answer is grounded in your real situation — not generic advice. It connects to your bank, tracks your net worth and spending, and gives you a financial briefing before you type a word. Open source. Local-first. Encrypted.

## Features

### Sensei-Fi additions in this fork

This fork includes a Sensei-Fi decision layer on top of Ray. See:

- `docs/senseifi-added-functionality.md`

Highlights include BNPL cash-pressure ledgering, purchase consultant flows, VPU tracking, strategic friction, APR promo-term modeling, a local web dashboard/chat surface, and deterministic debt payoff simulators.

### It gets smarter every conversation

- **Your situation, always loaded** — Every conversation starts with your financial profile: family, income, goals, strategy, key decisions, and open items. Ray reads it all before you type a word.
- **Self-updating context** — Got a raise? Had a baby? Decided to pay off debt aggressively? Ray updates your profile automatically when your situation changes.
- **Long-term memory** — Mention you're saving for a house or that you cancelled a subscription. Ray remembers across every future conversation.

### Stay on track without trying

- **CFO personality** — Ray doesn't list options. It tells you what it would do and why, references your goals, and flags problems you haven't noticed yet.
- **Daily scoring** — A 0-100 behavior score with streaks and 14 unlockable achievements. No restaurants for a week? That's Kitchen Hero. Five zero-spend days? Monk Mode.
- **Budgets and goals** — Track spending limits by category and progress toward financial goals.
- **Smart alerts** — Large transactions, low balances, budget overruns.

### Your data never leaves your machine

- **Encrypted local database** — All data stays on your machine in an AES-256 encrypted SQLite database.
- **PII masking** — Names, account numbers, and identifying details are scrubbed before anything reaches the AI. Your data is analyzed, not exposed.

### Set it and forget it

- **Bank sync via Plaid** — Connect checking, savings, credit cards, investments, and loans. Supports 🇺🇸 United States, 🇬🇧 United Kingdom, and 🇨🇦 Canada.
- **Scheduled daily sync** — Automatic bank sync via launchd (macOS) or cron (Linux).
- **Auto-recategorization** — Define rules to automatically re-label transactions.
- **Export/import** — Back up and restore your financial data.

## Install

```bash
npm install -g ray-finance
```

## Try It

Explore Ray with realistic fake data — no bank accounts needed.

```bash
ray demo                # seed a demo database
ray --demo status       # financial overview
ray --demo accounts     # linked accounts with balances
ray --demo spending     # spending breakdown by category
ray --demo budgets      # budget tracking
ray --demo goals        # financial goal progress
ray --demo score        # daily score, streaks, achievements
ray --demo alerts       # financial alerts
ray --demo transactions # recent transactions
```

The dashboard commands work with no setup at all. To also try the AI chat with demo data, run `ray setup` first and add an API key (Anthropic, OpenAI, or any OpenAI-compatible provider) — then `ray --demo` will start an interactive session where you can ask questions about the fake portfolio.

When you're ready to connect real accounts, run `ray link`.

## Quick Start

```bash
ray setup
```

The setup wizard offers two modes:

### Pro (quick setup)

We handle the API keys. Your data stays local. $10/mo.

1. Enter your name
2. Get a Ray API key (opens Stripe checkout)
3. Link your accounts — checking, savings, credit cards, investments, loans, mortgage
4. Done — daily sync auto-scheduled at 6am

### Bring your own keys

Bring your own AI and Plaid credentials. Free forever.

1. Pick your AI provider — Anthropic, OpenAI, Ollama (local), or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint
2. Enter your API key and pick a model
3. Enter your Plaid credentials ([get free keys](https://dashboard.plaid.com/signup))
4. Link your accounts — checking, savings, credit cards, investments, loans, mortgage
5. Done

                     (PII-masked)
```

Two outbound calls: Plaid (bank sync) and your AI provider (PII-masked). Supports Anthropic, OpenAI, Ollama, and any OpenAI-compatible endpoint. Your financial data is never stored off your machine. No telemetry. No analytics.

## Security & Privacy

- All financial data stored locally in `~/.ray/data/finance.db`
- Database encrypted with AES-256 (SQLCipher)
- Plaid access tokens encrypted at rest with AES-256-GCM
- Config file stored with `0600` permissions
- PII redacted before sending to any AI provider
- No data leaves your machine — only API calls to Plaid and your AI provider

## Configuration

Ray stores everything in `~/.ray/`:

```
~/.ray/
  config.json          # API keys and preferences (0600 permissions)
  context.md           # Persistent financial context for AI
  data/
    finance.db         # Encrypted SQLite database
    demo.db            # Demo database (created by `ray demo`)
  sync.log             # Daily sync output
```

### Environment Variables

You can also configure Ray via environment variables or a `.env` file:

```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=          # Anthropic API key (if using Anthropic)
OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_KEY=      # API key for OpenAI or compatible provider
OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_BASE_URL= # Base URL (e.g. https://api.openai.com/v1, http://localhost:11434/v1)
RAY_PROVIDER=               # "anthropic" or "openai-compatible"
RAY_MODEL=                  # Model name (e.g. claude-sonnet-4-6, gpt-4o, llama3.1)
PLAID_CLIENT_ID=            # Plaid client ID
PLAID_SECRET=               # Plaid secret key
PLAID_ENV=production        # Plaid environment
DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY=          # Database encryption key
PLAID_TOKEN_SECRET=         # Key for encrypting stored Plaid tokens
RAY_API_KEY=                # Ray API key (managed mode, replaces the above)
```
